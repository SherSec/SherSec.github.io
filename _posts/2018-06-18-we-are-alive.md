### We are still alive

We *are* still alive! Since we are a homeless hackerspace you may have trouble getting in touch with us.

  The best way to get us is via freenode, we are typically online 9-5 mon-fri EST.  However, as a typical IRC channel you will probably want to hang out for a couple hours to get a responce.
If you do not have an IRC client you can use this link to get access via the [freenode web client](http://webchat.freenode.net?nick=webuser&channels=%23shersec&uio=d4)
